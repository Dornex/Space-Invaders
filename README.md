# Space Invaders

University project for Web Techniques course. It is a website which is a presentation for the game Space Invaders. It also has a Javascript implementation of the game. The website includes a leaderboard with the highest scores, and I'm using MongoDB to save the users and scores in the database.

## Tools

1. NodeJS + Express ( for the web server )
2. Javascript ( for website animations and game )
3. MongoDB for database
4. Heroku for hosting the website
5. eJS for templates
