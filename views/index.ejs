    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>My name is Dorneanu Eduard-Gabriel, and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Bucharest. This is my
            project for 'Introduction to Web' class. My idea behind this project was to learn more things at once: Web Development,
            how to make Javascript Games and Databases. I knew from the start that this won't be an easy task, but I took the risk
            anyways.
        </p>
        <p>Depending on the state of the game, the goal is to beat all enemies. You get higher score, you get shown on the leaderboard.
            I am planning to make enemies harder as you play, and give the player lives.
